      <p class="p-type1">What is the difference between morality and legality?</p>
      <p class="p-type3">When we talk about morality and legality, we are talking about "acts".  Acts can be moral, immoral, legal and illegal.  Moral acts may be legal or illegal, and legal acts may be moral or immoral.  Morality and legality are not necessarily the same.  Some examples will illustrate these facts.</p>

      <p class="p-type3">It is not illegal to lie, but it is usually immmoral.</p>
      <p class="p-type3">It is not illegal to commit adultry, but it is immoral.</p>
      <p class="p-type3">It is not illegal to not do what you should do, but it is immoral.</p>
      <p class="p-type3">It is not illegal to imagine murdering someone, but it is immoral.</p>
      <p class="p-type3">It is not illegal for the CEO of a company to be compensated $100M or more a year while the employees of the company may receive less than minimum wage, but it is immoral.</p>
      <p class="p-type3">It is not illegal for a landlord to demand exorbitant rent from poor people, but it is immoral.</p>

      <p class="p-type3">It is not immoral to drive above the speed limit to save a life, but it is illegal.</p>
      <p class="p-type3">It is not immoral to forget to pay your taxes by the deadline, but it is illegal.</p>

      <p class="p-type3">If we have a healthy conscience, we can somehow know what is Right and Wrong.</p>
      
      <p class="p-type3"></p>
      <p class="p-type1"></p>

      <p class="p-type3">Most acts are neither Right nor Wrong such as eating an apple or taking a walk.</p>

      <p class="p-type3"></p>
      <p class="p-type1"></p>

      <p class="p-type1">It is important to understand the difference between morality and legality.  The number of possible immoral acts is semi-infinite so it is impossible for all immoral acts to be illegal.  No justice system could handle that.</p>

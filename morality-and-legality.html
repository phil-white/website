  <p class="message">What is the difference between morality and legality?</p>
  <p class="message2">When we talk about morality and legality, we are talking about "acts".  Acts can be moral, immoral, legal and illegal.  Moral acts may be legal or illegal, and legal acts may be moral or immoral.  Morality and legality are not the same.</p>

  <p class="message2">Some illustrations will illustrate the above facts.</p>

  <p class="message2">It is not illegal to imagine murdering someone, but it is immoral.</p>
  <p class="message2">It is not illegal for the CEO of a company to be compensated $100M or more a year while the employees of the company may receive less than minimum wage, but it is immoral.</p>

  <p class="message2">It is not immoral to drive above the speed limit to save a life, but it is illegal.</p>

  <p class="message2">------------------------------------------</p>


  <p class="message">It is important to understand the differences between morality and immorality.  The number of possible immoral acts is much greater than the number of possible illegal acts so it would be impossible for all immoral acts to be illegal.  No justice system could handle that.</p>

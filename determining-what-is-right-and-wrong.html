    <p class="p-top1">How do we determine what is Right and Wrong?</p>
    <p class="p-top2">There are different ways of determining what is Right and Wrong.  One way is to reason that any act that causes harm to another person is Wrong.  Another way is to consider what Jesus said since billions of people, Christians and non-Christians alike, consider him to be the greatest moral teacher in all history.  Jesus said the moral law can be summed up by saying everyone should love the Lord their God with all their heart, mind, soul and strength and their neighbor as themselves.  In other words, all loving acts are moral and all unloving acts are immoral.  We run into some difficulties.  Consider when someone asks our opinion about something, and, we believe if we tell the truth it will hurt their feelings so we might tell a lie, but isn't lying immoral?</p>
